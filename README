## Context2Vec example 

An application of the [context2vec: Learning Generic Context Embedding with Bidirectional LSTM](https://aclanthology.org/K16-1006) (Melamud et al., CoNLL 2016). It is a pretty simple word embeddings learning technique and the contrasting aspect with word2vec is that it has a lstm for getting a more precise contextual representation using bidirectional LSTM with a multi layer neural network at the top. 
Both word2vec and context2vec has the same loss function.
